# Term JSON-LD Files

In the following directories terms are stored in [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) files.  JSON-LD offers a compromise between being easy to with in popular programming languages as is the case with [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp), offering human-readable, language-independent communication of data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs in a hierarchical organization, and linked data which is vital for both describing vocabularies and using the web to connect related data that wasn't previously linked.

In NIDM-Terms we start by creating a JSON-LD file for each proposed term.  The terms are then discussed on GitHub, additional properties as outlined below are suggested by the community, and the terms are currated by putting them in context with related terms, super / sub type common data elements and ultimately added to [Interlex](https://scicrunch.org/nidm-terms) for ease of use.

Often people don't know about how their proposed terms should be linked with related concepts or other common data elements.  Don't worry, this is where our broader community comes in.  Submit a term with the most information you have and ask for others to help fill in the missing information!

To begin:

* Read the term property definitions below
* Fork the GitHub [terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms) repository
* Copy the [DataElementTemplate.jsonld](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/blob/master/terms/DataElementTemplate.jsonld) file and rename it as the label of your proposed term
* Fill in as much information in the JSON-LD file as you can and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the main repository


## Data Element Properties

Below is an exhaustive set of possible term properties.  The specific term you are proposing will dictate which properties below are needed.  See examples below for more information.

  * **"description":** An explanation of the nature, scope, or meaning of the new term.
  * **"url":** Typically when adding a new term the URL will be automatically generated when it is incorporated into the NIDM-Terms terminology. 
  * **"label":** Label for the term
  * **"source_variable":** Variable name from dataset
  * **"valueType":** A value representation such as integer, float, string, date/time (e.g. xsd:int, xsd:float, xsd:string): see [XSD Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_simple.asp)
  * **"unitCode":** Unit of measurement following [XSD Types](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#built-in-primitive-datatypes).  Typical types for terms include: xsd:boolean, xsd:integer, xsd:float, xsd:duration, xsd:dateTime, xsd:time, xsd:date, and xsd:anyURI.  For categorical variables please use xsd:complexType.   
  * **"maxValue":** The upper value of the data element
  * **"minValue":** The lower value of the data element
  * **"allowableValues":** For categorical variables the allowable values.  For example, handedness may be Right=1, Left=5, Ambidextrious=10 so the allowableValues is the set 1,5,10
  * **"choices":** Choices is a concept that corresponds to the [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) "levels" standard for categorical variables where you're mapping the value (often an integer) to some text string.  Using the handedness example from above, the choices would be {1=Right, 5=Left, 10=Ambidextrious}.  To encode this in JSON we use the "choices" element as shown:
  	```
	"choices": [
		{
		"name": "Right",
		"value": "1"
		},
		{
		"name": "Left",
		"value": "5"
		},
		{
		"name": "Ambidextrious",
		"value": "10"
		}
	]
	```
  
  * **"isAbout":** Used to store a mapping to a broader concept related to the data element. These annotations can be used to search across datasets. Concept annotations should only be used for terms you think are useful to search across datasets.  For example, if one has a variable that measures "age at visit" with a particular frame of reference (e.g. postnatal) in a particular unit (e.g. months) and another dataset collected a variable "age at scan" with units "year" then we can annotate both variables with a broader concept of [age](http://uri.interlex.org/base/ilx_0100400) and use this to search for datasets with the concept of "age" without regarding how age was collected.  This approach helps with locating datasets that contain information desired by investigators while abstracting away from the complexity of how these data were stored in the datasets. Once datasets have been identified at this high level, the data dictionaries for each variable in each dataset can be further interrogated using the properties here to determine a proper mapping across variables prior to analysis.  "isAbout" entries using the [DataElementTemplate.jsonld](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/blob/master/terms/DataElementTemplate.jsonld) are formatted as follows.  Multiple "isAbout" annotations can be formatted in a similar fashion to "choices" using an array ([]) of dictionaries.
  	```
    "isAbout": {
      "@id": "ilx_id:ilx_0100400",
      "label": "age"
    }
	```
  * **"associatedWith":**  This can be kept as it is in the [DataElementTemplate.jsonld](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/blob/master/terms/DataElementTemplate.jsonld).  It is used by the [Interlex](https://scicrunch.org/nidm-terms) information resource to group data elements into buckets where one can quickly query for all data elements that have been used in "NIDM" for example.  One can add additional strings here to do further groupings (e.g. "BIDS" if the data element is part of the canonical BIDS specification).
  
  ### Additional Properties
  
The following properties are not typically added by users for data element definitions.  These properties are added by currators who are linking information resources together (e.g. isPartOf, subtypeCDEs, supertypeCDEs).
  
  * **"isPartOf":** Used to link data elements to assessments (e.g. WASI_Vocab_Raw linked to [WASI scale](https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/task/id/tsk_4a57abb949f12/#).  Typically this is not added by the user and is often done as an additional annotation to link data elements with other clases of information.
  * **"measureOf":** Describe what the data element measures (e.g. volume, area, distance, intensity, health status, duration/period, intelligence).  
  * **"datumType":** What type of datum it is (e.g. range,count,scalar etc.): see [IAO definitions](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/STATO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000109)
  * **"provenance":** A description of how the data element is recorded or derived, where it came from, etc.
  * **"subtypeCDEs":** This property is typically added during term curation.  It links the term to lower-level (child) terms in the NIDM-Terms terminology if applicable.
  * **"supertypeCDEs":** This property is typically added during term curation.  It links the term to higher-level (parent) terms in the NIDM-Terms terminology if applicable.
