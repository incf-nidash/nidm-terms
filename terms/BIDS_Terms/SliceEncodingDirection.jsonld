  "description": "RECOMMENDED. Possible values: i, j, k, i-, j-, k- (the axis of the NIfTI data along which slices were acquired, and the direction in which SliceTiming is defined with respect to). i, j, k identifiers correspond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIfTI file. A - sign indicates that the contents of SliceTiming are defined in reverse order - that is, the first entry corresponds to the slice with the largest index, and the final entry corresponds to slice index zero. When present, the axis defined by SliceEncodingDirection needs to be consistent with the slice dim field in the NIfTI header. When absent, the entries in SliceTiming must be in the order of increasing slice index as defined by the NIfTI header.",
