  "description": "REQUIRED. The time in seconds between the beginning of an acquisition of one volume and the beginning of acquisition of the volume following it (TR). Please note that this definition includes time between scans (when no data has been acquired) in case of sparse acquisition schemes. This value needs to be consistent with the pixdim[4] field (after accounting for units stored in xyzt units field) in the NIfTI header. This field is mutually exclusive with VolumeTiming and is derived from DICOM Tag 0018, 0080 and converted to seconds.",
