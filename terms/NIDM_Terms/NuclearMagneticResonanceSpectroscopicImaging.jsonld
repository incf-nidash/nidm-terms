  "description": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging is an acquisition modality in which radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation is used to excite nuclei of the study participant, the characteristics of the detected signal are used to generate intensity contrast over a restricted (usually grid-like) area, and the resulting signal is displayed as a spectrum for each one of the spatially-resolved areas.",
