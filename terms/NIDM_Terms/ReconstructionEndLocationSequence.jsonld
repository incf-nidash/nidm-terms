  "description": "Anatomically oriented transverse location where this reconstruction ends. This represents the end of the data used in the reconstruction, not necessarily the slice location of the last reconstructed slice. This represents the intended end location. The operator may or may not have selected a location that exactly matches this anatomical location. In the case where an anatomical reference basis cannot be determined or borrowed from the Defined Protocol instance, for example when an ad hoc reconstruction is being performed, the implementation may use the acquired volume (128160, DCM, Acquired Volume) as the reference basis with an appropriate offset. Only a single item is permitted in the sequence.",
