  "description": "A sequence that identifies the set of Raw Data SOP Class/Instance pairs of the Raw data that were used to derive this Image. The items of in this Sequence may identify raw data that has not been stored or encoded as a DICOM object. This allows recognition that images and spectra in different instances have been reconstructed from the same raw data. For such items the SOP Class UID would be '1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.66' (Raw Data SOP Class) and the SOP Instance UID would be any appropriate UID.",
