  "description": "Identifies a prior image set in abstract terms. Exactly two integer values, indicating the range of prior studies to include. Each value shall be greater than zero, where 1 indicates the most recent prior and higher values indicate successively older priors. The special value -1 shall indicate the oldest prior. The value pair n,n indicates the nth prior. The value pair -1/-1 indicates the oldest prior. The value pair m/n indicates the mth through nth priors, where m is the more recent prior. The value pair 1/-1 indicates all priors. The value pair m/-1 indicates the mth prior and all priors older than m. Required if Image Set Selector Category (0072,0034) is ABSTRACT_PRIOR and Abstract Prior Code Sequence (0072,003E) is not present.",
