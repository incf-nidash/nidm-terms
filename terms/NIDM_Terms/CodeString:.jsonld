  "description": "A string of characters identifying a controlled concept, including Defined Terms and Enumerated Values when represented as character strings. The scope of the controlled concept is limited to the attribute for which the string provides the value; i.e., the attribute defines the allowed set of values for the Code String, and a particular string may have different meanings in different attributes. A Code String is formally an arbitrary code representing a semantic concept; however, English language words (using the constrained character set of the CS Value Representation) are often used as codes for the semantics of those words.",
