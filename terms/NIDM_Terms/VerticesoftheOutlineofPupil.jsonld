  "description": "A set of row/column vertices that outline the perimeter of the pupil. Two or more pairs of values follow and are the row and column coordinates of the other vertices that outline the perimeter of the pupil. For a two dimensional curve: X1, Y1, X2, Y2, etc. The first (X) dimension corresponds to the image column (horizontal offset), and the second (Y) dimension corresponds to the image row (vertical offset). This is a Polyline and the points are to be interpreted as an n-tuple list of end points between which straight lines are to be drawn.",
