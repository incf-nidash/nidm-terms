  "description": "Identification of Series significantly related to this Series. For example, for a combined CT and PET acquisition, the CT images and PET images would be in separate series that could cross-reference each other with multiple purpose of reference codes meaning same anatomy, simultaneously acquired and same indication. The related series may have different Frames of Reference and hence require some sort of registration before spatial coordinates can be directly compared. This attribute is not intended for conveying localizer reference information, for which Referenced Image Sequence (0008,1140) should be used.",
