  "comment": "This term is a special case of nidm:SusceptibilityWeighted, in which the image contrast is primarily due to differences in magnetic susceptibility of oxygenated versus de-oxygenated blood. Susceptibility weighting can have numerous causes, such as differences in tissue iron content.",
