  "description": "An ordered set of one or more integers that uniquely identifies the Target Content Item of the relationship. The root Content Item is referenced by a single value of 1. Each subsequent integer represents an ordinal position of a Content Item in the Content Sequence (0040,A730) in which it belongs. The Referenced Content Item Identifier is the set of these ordinal positions along the by-value relationship path. The number of values in this Multi-Value Attribute is exactly the number of relationships traversed in the SR content tree plus one.",
