  "description": "A centre of gravity of the cluster, equivalent to the concept of Centre Of Gravity for a object with distributed mass, where intensity substitutes for mass in this case. The 'Coordinate' of the centre of gravity is the weighted average of the cluster element (e.g., pixels, voxels, vertices, or faces) 'Coordinate's, where the weighting factors are the cluster element intensities.
