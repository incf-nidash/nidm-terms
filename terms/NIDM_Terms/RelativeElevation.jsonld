  "description": "Relative elevation, in micrometers, is calculated from the corneal surface distance from a reference surface (i.e., a sphere or ellipsoid) that intersects the corneal vertex. This value is determined from z - zref. Where z is conveyed in Attribute Corneal Point Location (0046,0247) and zref is the elevation of the reference surface.",
