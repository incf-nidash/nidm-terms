  "description": "Poisson distribution is a probability distribution used to model the number of events occurring within a given time interval. It is defined by a real number (\u03bb) and an integer k representing the number of events and a function. The expected value of a Poisson-distributed random variable is equal to \u03bb and so is its variance. (Definition from STATO).",
