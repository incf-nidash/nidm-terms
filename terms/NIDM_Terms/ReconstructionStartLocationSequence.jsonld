  "description": "Anatomically oriented transverse location where this reconstruction starts. This represents the start of the data used in the reconstruction, not necessarily the slice location of the first reconstructed slice. This represents the intended start location. The operator may or may not have selected a location that exactly matches this anatomical location. In the case where an anatomical reference basis cannot be determined or derived from the Defined Protocol instance, for example when an ad hoc reconstruction is being performed, the implementation may use the acquired volume (128160, DCM, Acquired Volume) as the reference basis with an appropriate offset.",
