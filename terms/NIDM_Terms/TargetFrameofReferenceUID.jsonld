For example, in a performed protocol it may be useful to record the Frame of Reference UID used in a prior study that was used as a reference. The Frame of Reference UID (0020,0052) in the image instances resulting from the performance of this protocol will likely be different than this Target Frame of Reference UID since perfect alignment is likely unachievable.",
