  "description": "A cuboid containing the source volume data to be included. The axes of the cuboid are aligned to the axes of encoded source volume. The bounding box is defined by the (x,y,z) coordinates in mm of two opposite corners in the Volumetric Presentation State Reference Coordinate System. If the source volume consists of gantry tilted slices (e.g., CT) then the bounding box will be a cuboid in the encoded image space, but a parallelepiped in the VPS-RCS. ",
