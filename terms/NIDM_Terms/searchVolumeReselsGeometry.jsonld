  "description": "Description of geometry of search volume.  As per Worsley et al. [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20408186 ], for space dimension 3 the first element is the Euler Characteristic of the search volume, the second element is twice the average caliper diameter, the third element is half the surface area, and the fourth element is the volume.  With the exception of the first element (which is a unitless integer) all quantities are in units of Resels.",
