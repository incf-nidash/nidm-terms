  "description": "The 'Binomial Distribution' is a discrete probability distribution which describes the probability of k successes in n draws with replacement from a finite population of size N. The 'Binomial Distribution' is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. The 'Binomial Distribution' gives the discrete probability distribution of obtaining exactly n successes out of N Bernoulli trials (where the result of each Bernoulli trial is true with probability p and false with probability q=1-p ) notation: B(n,p) The mean is N*p The variance is N*p*q. (Definition from STATO).",
