Multiple Values where the first set of two values are: row of the origin vertex; column of the origin vertex. Two or more pairs of values follow and are the effective pixel row and column coordinates of the other vertices of the polygon Exposure Control Sensing Region. Polygon Exposure Control Sensing Regions are implicitly closed from the last vertex to the origin vertex and all edges shall be non-intersecting except at the vertices.",
