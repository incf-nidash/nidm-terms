  "description": "True fast imaging with steady state precession (TrueFISP) is a gradient recalled echo based magnetic resonance imaging acquisition method in which a series of phase-alternating radiofrequency pulses are applied, in conjunction with a balanced set of gradients, generating free induction decays and a steady-state transverse magnetization, the signal from which is collected.",
