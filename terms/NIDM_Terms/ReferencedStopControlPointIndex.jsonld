This is the second of the two Control Points from which the Dose contribution to the Control Point can be calculated. The Control Point Index (300A,0112) referenced by Referenced Stop Control Point Index (300C,00F6) shall be the Control Point Index (300A,0112) immediately following the Control Point Index (300A,0112) referenced by Referenced Start Control Point Index (300C,00F4) within the Referenced Beam Number (300C,0006).",
