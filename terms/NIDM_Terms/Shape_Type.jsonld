  "description": " For convenient registration, correlated Fiducials exist in each image set of the Registration Sequence. Correlated Fiducials are identified with either Fiducial Identifier (0070,0310) or Fiducial Identifier Code Sequence (0070,0311). Shape Type (0070,0306) defines the geometric interpretation of Contour Data (3006,0050) and Graphic Data (0070,0022). A point is defined as a triplet (x,y,z) in the case of spatial data or a pair (x,y) in the case of graphic data.",
