This term is based on the STATO term http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000097, Participant Under Investigation Role.  STATO also has the term Specimen, which can be a Participant, but is not necessarily, since the Specimen itself may not be the thing under investigation, ie, it may be a constituent of the Specimen that the what is actually under investigation.",
