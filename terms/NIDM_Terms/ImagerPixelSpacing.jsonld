  "description": "Physical distance measured at the front plane of the Image Receptor housing between the center of each pixel. Specified by a numeric pair - row spacing value (delimiter) column spacing value - in mm. In the case of CR, the front plane is defined to be the external surface of the CR plate closest to the patient and radiation source.  The value of this attribute shall never be adjusted to account for correction for the effect of geometric magnification or calibration against an object of known size; Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) is specified for that purpose.",
