    "Note that this is similar to, but distinct from a dependent variable, which is a variable that changes in response to changes in a system.  The T2 value would be an example of a dependent variable since changing the echo time allows for calculation of the T2.  Cerebral Blood Flow (CBV) is an example of a Calculated Parameter since it is measure by taking a series of images after the injection of a contrast agent; however the experimenter is not actually changing any independent variable to see a change in the CBV and therefore it is a Calculated Parameter rather than a dependent variable."
