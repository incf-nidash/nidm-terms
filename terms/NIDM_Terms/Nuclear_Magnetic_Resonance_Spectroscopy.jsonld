  "description": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an acquisition modality in which radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation is used to excite nuclei of the sample or subject, the characteristics of the detected signal are used to generate signal intensity contrast over an entire selected volume, and the resulting signal is displayed as a signal spectrum rather than as matrix meant to be a representation of the underlying object.",

  "supertypeCDEs": "http://purl.org/nidash/nidm#AcquisitionModality",
  "comment": "The volume of interest may be selected either by the natural extent of the excited volume (e.g., surface coils) or by selecting for excitation, a thick slab through the use of magnetic field gradients.",
