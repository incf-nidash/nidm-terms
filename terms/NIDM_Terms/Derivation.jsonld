    "An instance of prov:Derivation provides additional descriptions about the binary prov:wasDerivedFrom relation from some derived prov:Entity to another prov:Entity from which it was derived. For example, :chewed_bubble_gum prov:wasDerivedFrom :unwrapped_bubble_gum; prov:qualifiedDerivation [ a prov:Derivation; prov:entity :unwrapped_bubble_gum; :foo :bar ].",
    "The more specific forms of prov:Derivation (i.e., prov:Revision, prov:Quotation, prov:PrimarySource) should be asserted if they apply."
