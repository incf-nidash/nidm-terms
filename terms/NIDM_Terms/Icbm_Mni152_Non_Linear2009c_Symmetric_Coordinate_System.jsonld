  "description": "Reference space defined as the average of 152 T1-weighted MRI scans, non-linearly transformed to form a symmetric model in MNI152 linear space using the N3 algorithm (cf. http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009 for more details). This is the default for DARTEL toolbox in SPM12b (cf. spm12/spm_templates.man).",
