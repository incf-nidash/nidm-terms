  "description": "Spacing between slices, in mm, measured from center-to-center of each slice along the normal to the first image. The sign of the Spacing Between Slices (0018,0088) determines the direction of stacking. The normal is determined by the cross product of the direction cosines of the first row and first column of the first frame, such that a positive spacing indicates slices are stacked behind the first slice and a negative spacing indicates slices are stacked in front of the first slice.",
