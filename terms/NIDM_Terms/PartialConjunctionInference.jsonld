  "description": "The process of testing the joint significance of multiple effects to infer that some (not necessarily all) of the respective effects are real (i.e. their null hypotheses are false). If there are K effects considered, the 'partial Conjunction Degree' u is the number non-null effects allowed as part of partial conjunction null hypothesis; if the partial conjunction null is rejected, it may be inferred that u+1 or more effects are real. The case of u=K-1 corresponds to proper \"'Conjunction Inference'\", while the case of u=0 corresponds to \"global null\" conjunction test. See [Friston et al. (2005). Conjunction revisited.
