  "description": "A measure of sensorimotor ability. Also, it was designed to familiarize the participant with the computer mouse used during most of the WebCNP tasks. During the MPraxis, the participant needs to move the computer mouse cursor over an ever-shrinking green box and click on it once each time it appears on a different location on the test-page. If participants can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complete the MPraxis, it is likely they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to complete any other WebCNP task.",
