  "description": "Sleep and wakefulness are endogenous, recurring, behavioral states that reflect coordinated changes in the dynamic functional organization of the brain and that optimize physiology, behavior, and health. Homeostatic and circadian processes regulate the propensity for wakefulness and sleep. Sleep is a reversible state, characterized by postural recumbence, behavioral quiescence, and reduced responsiveness. It involves predictable cycling of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM). It is affected by experiences during wakefulness, and has restorative and transformative effects that optimize neurobehavioral functions during wakefulness.",
