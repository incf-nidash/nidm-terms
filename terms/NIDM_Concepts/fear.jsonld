  "description": "A state of high negative emotional arousal triggered by an impending threat (real or imaginary) and generally associated with the flight or fight response. Fear is the activation of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defensive motivational system to promote behaviors that protect the organism from perceived danger. Normal fear involves a pattern of adaptive responses to conditioned or unconditioned threat stimuli (exteroceptive or interoceptive). Fear can involve internal representations and cognitive processing, and can be modulated by a variety of factors.",
